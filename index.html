		<h1>Weekend Project: webcam-random-numbers</h1>
		<p>
			This small project is the synthesis of several bits and pieces I found on the web.
		</p>

		<h2>Inspiration</h2>
		<p>
			This project was mostly inspired by a YouTube video, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lvm9gL4KVQg">The Alpha Webcam Scintillator</a>".
		</p>

		<h2>Hardware</h2>
		<a name="hardware" />
		<p>
			The hardware consists of two main parts.  First is the gutted webcam sensor with it's filters removed. You can see how to remove said filters in the YouTube video above.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second part is a sample of Americium pulled from a cheap smoke detector. This radioactive metal is the source of the alpha particles we are detecting.
		</p>
		<p>
			These two components are shielded with aluminum foil, then pressed together with electrical tape. I packaged it all up in a hobby project box for a nicer presentation and closer to complete darkness.

		<h3>Webcam Damage</h3>
		<a name="hardware-webcam-damage" />
		<p>
			When I first created this, I didn't take into account the fact that Alpha radiation is, well, destructive.  My first sensor was dying after less than 24 hours of creation, both with bad pixels and bad encoding.  I started getting a lot of bad and dropped frames.
		</p>

		</p>

		<p>
			With my second sensor I took some precautions against this damage.  The first was aluminum foil shielding on the circuitry. The second was a tissue paper shield between the Americium and the sensor to reduce the number and power of particles getting through. Time will tell how much of a difference this makes, but visually it appears to have worked.
		</p>

		<h2>Software</h2>
		<a name="software" />
		<p>
			My software uses OpenCV to access the camera sensor and iterate over the pixels. The psuedo code for the process is:
			<pre>
for pixel in frame:
  if pixel white:
    shift least significant bit of pixel index ( row * width + column ) onto buffer
    if buffer full:
      write buffer to file
    skip a few rows ( to avoid re-registering the same alpha scintillation )
      </pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			I know very little about random numbers, so my methodology may be flawed.
		</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<a name="results" />

    <p>
      I don't currently have any big samples to test since my sensor died. I'm working on capturing a large file with my new sensor.
